A simple recipe sharing application for those that love to cook, where users can share, view and search for recipes. 

It was built using javaScript, html, css, mySQL, node.js, express and an Edamam API.

the first page is an index page that shows you the about page, my own API for the recipes and the pages you need to have an account for. 
If users click these authorised pages a session id will be used in their browser to see if they're logged in or not and determines the page they see. 
From there users are can either log in or register to share, view and search for recipes.
